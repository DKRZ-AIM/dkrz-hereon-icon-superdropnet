## Notes

### Compile

TODO: All this goes in the Makefile

1. Compile the shared object (dynamic library): `python builder.py`
2. Execute the current Makefile
3. Need to add the current directory to the search path for SOs at runtime:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/work/ka1176/caroline/gitlab/202
2-03-hereon-python-fortran-bridges/src/"
```

### Changing functions

https://www.noahbrenowitz.com/post/calling-fortran-from-python/

Any python function that we want to expose to fortran must be defined in 3 places. First, its C header declaration must be put in header.h. Second, its implementation must be defined in the module string of builder.pyâ€”or in an external module as described above. Finally, the fortran code must contain an interface block defining the subroutine.
