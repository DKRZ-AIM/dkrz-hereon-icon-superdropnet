## Notes

### Compile

The Makefile compiles the shared object (dynamic library) `libplugin.so` along with the Fortran modules. 

#### Mistral

To run the demo:

```bash
cd first_demo

module load intel intelmpi

make clean
make my_demo

# Need to add the current directory to the search path for SOs at runtime
# change this to your git root directory
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/work/ka1176/caroline/gitlab/202
2-03-hereon-python-fortran-bridges/src/"

# need to update the pythonpath (?)
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"/work/ka1176/caroline/gitlab/202
2-03-hereon-python-fortran-bridges/src/"

# execute
./my_demo
```

Alternatively using MPI on the Fortran side:

```bash
make my_demo_mpi

# alternatively execute using MPI with 4 processes
mpirun -np 4 ./my_demo
```

Note from `https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/embedding.html`:

> You can avoid the LD_LIBRARY_PATH issue if you compile libmy_plugin.so with the path hard-coded inside in the first place.

#### Levante

```bash
module load python3
module load intel-oneapi-compilers

cd first_demo

make

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"..."
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"..."

./my_demo
```

### Changing functions

Using CFFI: https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.6/

> Any python function that we want to expose to fortran must be defined in 3 places. First, its C header declaration must be put in header.h. Second, its implementation must be defined in the module string of builder.pyâ€”or in an external module as described above. Finally, the fortran code must contain an interface block defining the subroutine.
